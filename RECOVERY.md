# Personal recovery fork

Recovered 27 September 2026 for pepax after the upstream repositories became private.
Source: 3dyuval/kulala.nvim; verified identical to installed dcad056 source. Original licences and attribution are retained.

Upstream workflows are preserved in `.github/upstream-workflows` but are not active; they assume upstream publishing infrastructure.

The initial Core release is `0.37.0-pepax.1`, built from recovered source, not a claim that the source matches upstream 0.37.0. Only macOS Apple Silicon is initially built and tested. Other platforms need separate builds and validation.

## Lazy installation

Use `pepax/kulala.nvim` in place of `mistweaverco/kulala.nvim`. Existing options and shortcuts can stay. Core and parser downloads use pepax repositories.
Parser registration preserves existing runtime-path precedence rather than moving the shared site directory behind bundled Neovim queries.
